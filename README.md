# 6502_Assembly_Simulator
A Simple Simulator for students to use to learn Assembly Language

This is a work in progress.  Currently a number of commands have been coded, but there are still a lot to go.

# To Try It Out
 - Download the repository and run simulator.py using Python 2 or Python 3
 - You should see a number of different colored pixels (squares) appear row by row in the top half of the display.

# Known Issues
 - For some reason, the display can freeze on Mac. This is a known bug in tkinter on the Mac. Interestingly, it occurs when the background of the tkinter canvas is black along with the rectangles used as "pixels". Changing the pixel color to all white, or all green, for example seems to alleviate the issue.
