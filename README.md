# 6502_Assembly_Simulator
A Simple Simulator for students to use to learn Assembly Language

This is a work in progress.  Only a few instructions have been coded, but the simulator does work.

# To Try It Out
 - Download the repository and run simulator.py using Python 3 (It will NOT work in Python 2.)
 - You should see a number of different colored pixels (squares) appear row by row in the top half of the display.

# Known Issues
 - For some reason, the display can freeze on Mac. This is a known bug in tkinter on the Mac
